One hundred and ninety-one floors up, you look over the edge of the roof and the street
below is mottled with a shag carpet of people, standing, looking up. The breaking glass is a
window right below us. A window blows out the side of the building, and then comes a file
cabinet big as a black refrigerator, right below us a six-drawer filing cabinet drops right out of
the cliff face of the building, and drops turning slowly, and drops getting smaller,
and drops disappearing into the packed crowd.
